  description: >
    Management API is designed to support complete SNMP Simulator work flow
    remotely. As such, Management API supports SNMP Agent creation,
    configuration and eventual tear down. Simulation data can be uploaded,
    modified, removed and exposed under different circumstances. On top of
    that, SNMP agents can be grouped together to form "virtual lab" that
    can be brought up/down altogether.


    Typical management work flow looks like this:


    1. Create SNMP Agent using `/agents` REST API endpoint. You can supply
       complete agent configuration at once or add/modify it incrementally.
       Important configuration items include: SNMP Engine ID, SNMPv3 VACM
       user(s) credentials.

       The other important aspect of agent configuration is its simulation
       data selection rules. These take shape of `selectors` strings guiding
       agent's probing `.snmprec` files under simulation data directory.
       The default selector set is applied automatically if not given.

    2. Create SNMP transport endpoint(s) using `/endpoints`. These are the
       address(es) where SNMP agent is listening for inbound SNMP commands.
       When creating an endpoint, bind it to one specific SNMP agent.

    3. Create SNMP simulation data by uploading the entire `.snmprec` file
       via `/recordings` endpoint. The path and the name of this file
       is used by the agent for simulation data selection.

    4. Optionally, add your new SNMP agent to a new or existing lab via
       `/labs` endpoint.

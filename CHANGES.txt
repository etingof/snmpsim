0.2.1
-----

- WARNING: this release brings some backward incompatibilities in
    * variation modules names and options
    * snmpsimd.py community names (in Windows platform)
    * stock variation modules installation location
  Please read the changes below for more information.
- License updated to vanilla BSD 2-Clause
  (http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
- Variation modules can now participate in .snmprec production what
  can be used for capturing additional information about SNMP Agent
  being snapshotted in .snmprec files.
  The following changes have been made to the system:
  * the snmprec.py tool can be passed variation module name.
  * variation modules can now define the 'record' callable which
    will be given a chance to influence snmprec record being written.
  * existing 'process' callable in variation modules renamed into
    'variate' for clarity.
  * variation modules' init() and shutdown() methods accept **context,
    'mode' parameter being passed indicating current operation mode.
  * variation modules running in recording mode can communicate to
    the upper levels that they either won't produce any data on the
    current invocation or request another round of SNMP Agent walk.
- Variation modules options now take shape of a key-value pairs. This
  might break backward compatibility with 0.2.0!
- The counter.py and gauge.py variation modules merged into a single
  numeric.py module which also supports INTEGER&TIMETICKS values as
  well as recording feature.
- The involatilecache.py and volatilecache.py modules merged into a
  single writecache.py module which also supports SET value verification
  against per-OID access list.
- The error.py variation module extended to support variation based on
  SET value.
- The delay.py variation module extended to support variation based on
  SET value and time of date.
- Recording functionality added to the delay.py and numeric.py modules.
- The new "multiplex" variation module added to be able to record
  and replay a sequence of .snmprec files ordered by time.
- SNMP GETBULK operation is now supported by snmprec.py.
- Redesign of grammar objects -- the new concept is that they
  are only responsible for basic record layout, fields normalization.
  and SNMP types resolution. However complex field formatting (such
  as grammar-specific tag modifiers) is now up to higher-level
  'Record' objects.
- Simulator-generated community names now uses '/' as path separator
  regardless of the platform. This allows for unified Simulator view
  in terms of community and context names across the platforms.
- Snapshot files recording now works under Python3.
- Install data and variation modules into package root to make easy_install
  work again. Search thesee directories at runtime as a last resort - prefer
  system or home locations as it is more natural to keep changing data there.
- Simulator is now more tolerant to duplicate variation modules (just ignores
  recently found) and catches duplicate data files (also ignores more recent).
- On Windows, search both data and variation modules into %PROGRAMFILES%

0.2.0
-----

- Major overhaul aimed at adding value variation features to the Simulator
  core:
  * data files may now hold not only terminal OIDs but also OID subtrees
  * pluggable value variation modules interfaces and basic modules added
  * write support added through the use of appropriate variation modules
  * SQL backend for keeping and modifying SNMP snapshots added in form of
    a value variation module
  * subprocess execution variation module added what could be used
    for external process invocation on SNMP request to Simulator
  * SNMP Notification Originator variation module added what could be
    used for sending SNMP TRAP/INFORM messages to SNMP entities
    on SNMP requests to Simulator
- SNMP snapshots now being called 'data files' rather than 'device files'
  which is a legacy term.
- Data files and variation modules are now installed into platform-specific
  directories.
- Data files and variation modules are now looked up at several, 
  platform-specific, locations including $HOME/.snmpsim
- Simulator data files indices are now created and kept in a dedicated
  temporary directory which is also configurable though snmpsimd command-line.
- Example data files simplified, more native and foreign snapshots added.
- Fix to snmprec.py not to record end-of-mib.
- Fix to py2exe settings of setup.py

0.1.6
-----

- Net-SNMP's .snmpwalk files created with the "snmpwalk -ObentU" command
  can now be used by the Simulator directly.
- SimpleAgentPro's .sapwalk files support added to Simulator.
- Fixes to --start-oid & --stop-oid params to make the working again.
- Simulator reports supported device files types on startup.
- Shared device files now supported. Snapshots can now be indicated
  as shared through a symbolic link. Managers can use different
  credentials to access and modify the same set of Managed Objects.
  
0.1.5
-----

- Simulator device file selection by a combination of ContextName,
  Transport ID and source address implemented.
- Rudimentary MIB write support added (snmpset now works). Still need to
  support MIB-defined constraints.
- Fix to snmpsimd.py to ignore possibly missing .dbm file on failed
  index rebuild.
- Fix to OID search code what used to always pick the first OID in file
  while looking for EOL (Python3 only).

0.1.4
-----

- Simulator device file selection by a combination of Community,
  Transport ID and source address implemented (for --v2c-arch mode).
- UDP/IPv6 and UNIX domain socket transports support added to
  snmpsimd.py and snmprec.py tools.
- The snmpsimd.py and snmprec.py tools now support additional SNMPv3 
  authentication (SHA) and encryption (3DES, AES192, AES256) algorithms
  provided by pysnmp.
- Simulator now supports binding to and listening at multiple local
  endpoints. The --agent-address & --agent-port options are now obsolete.
- The snmprec.py tool Agent address specification syntax unified with that
  of snmpsimd.py.
- Multiple --device-dir c/l options are now supported by snmpsimd.py.
- Some runtime diagnostics added to snmprec.py.
- The snmpsimd.py tool unconditionally rebuilds existing indices of
  unknown format.
- Device files handling indexing made faster by not calling <fileobj>.tell().
  That also required opening files in 'binary' mode to make sure offset
  calculation will work correctly.
- Attempt to open DBM in "fast" and "unsync" modes when building indices
  to speed-up index generation.
- Package meta information updated.
- Fix to snmprec.py to make SNMP debugging working again.
- Fix to snmprec.py to properly support non-default SNMP context name.
- Fix to infinite loop possibly occurring at OID search routine.
- Fix to DBM key type (string vs byte issue)
- Fix to mib2dev.py MIB path handling.
- Fix to index object to make "snmpwalk -c index" work again.
- Fix to index object registration in --v2c-arch mode.
- Fix to SNMPv2 exception objects translation into SNMPv1 PDU in the
  --v2c-arch mode

0.1.3
-----

- Initial revision of the mib2dev.py tool.
- Some more MIB-originated device files added.

0.1.2
-----

- Some more py2k refactoring (some features did not work otherwise).
- Fix to values tags matching at snmpsimd.py (simulator did not work
  otherwise).
- Fixes to sys.exc_info invocation.

0.1.1
-----

- Major overhawl for Python 2.4 -- 3.2 compatibility:
  + drop explicit long integer type use
  + map()/filter() replaced with list comprehension
  + apply() replaced with */**args
  + dictionary operations made 2K/3K compatible
  + division operator made 2K/3K compatible
  + exception syntax made 2K/3K compatible
  + tuple function arguments resolved to scalars to become py3k compatible

0.0.11
------

- --agent-port handling bug fixed in snmprec.py

0.0.10
------

- --v3-arch command-line flag added to save on large number of
  [expensive] addV1System() calls.
- setuptools dependencies improved

0.0.9
-----

- Simulator now builds a table of loaded device files in a
  dedicated 'index' context.
- Use OS-specific file extension separator for better portability.
- Support .db extensions voluntarily added by gdbm on OS X.
- Fix to null-typed value read from .dump device file.
- Legacy SNMPv1/v2c community string generation policy dropped.
- SNMPv3 VACM initialization dropped altogether, as the specialized
  SMI backend used by Simulator does not implement access control.
- Fix to support zero-length device files.
- Ignore value syntax errors in device files occured when responding.
- Optionally validate device file data while indexing.
- Allow forced device files re-indexing.
- Fix to broken IP address serialization code in recorder.

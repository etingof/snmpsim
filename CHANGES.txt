Revision 0.3.0, released 28-09-2015
-----------------------------------

- Simulator now depends on the latest pysnmp features introduced in 
  pysnmp version 4.3.0
- Introducing initial MIB compiler (PySMI) integration. Most command-line
  tools can now be given MIB symbols rather than OIDs. Requested
  MIBs will be automatically downloaded from http://mibs.snmplabs.com/ .
- New Redis-backed variation module implemented to let users record into
  and replay simulation data from noSQL key-value store optionally
  involving server-side Lua scripting.
- Full-line comments (#-based) and empty lines are now allowed in data files.
- When recording .snmprec data, hex everything if a non-alpha/numeric
  literal is present in a value. This eliminates possible issues with
  unescaped contents in a SQL-based recorder.
- New --max-varbinds option can now be used for limiting the number
  of variable bindings in SNMP response message on a per-engine-id
  basis. Global default is now 64 variable bindings.
- Multiple SNMP ContextEngineID can now be configured per each of possibly
  many SNMP Engine IDs.
- SNMP configuration logging reworked for better clarity.
- The notification module now binds to the same local interface through
  which Simulator received CommandRequest triggering notification. 
  Also it supports 'bindaddr' option to override the above behaviour on
  a per-OID basis.
- The sql variation module not switches default SQL transaction isolation
  level to 'READ COMMITTED'. Isolation level (0-3) could now be specified
  on per-instance basis through 'isolationlevel' option.
- The subprocess variation module improved to expose more SNMP engine
  parameters to user process.
- Switched to the latest pysnmp's requestObserver facility for getting
  request details from pysnmp core.
- Numeric module's 'function' parameter now accepts optional arguments.
- The snmprec.py tool improved to optionally survive SNMP PDU-level errors
  and keep walking remote Agent using an OID derived from the failed one.
- Configurable SNMP request timeout and retry count settings now supported
  by the snmprec.py tool.
- The --context-engine-id option support added to snmprec.py tool.
- Hex values can now be passed to --v3-context-\* options to snmprec.py tool
- Variation modules options separators can now be escaped by doubling or
  tripling them.
- All logging moved to Python logging framework. Some more log targets (such
  as remote syslog) added.
- Low-level SNMP and ASN.1 debugging implemented for all relevant scripts.
- Configure both plain-text and hashed versions of snmpCommunityName,
  contextName whenever its length does not exceed 32 chars. That might ease
  ContextName usage for Agent addressing.

- Fix to log file autorotation feature.
- Fix to pcap2dev.py not to loose the last trailing OID in capture.
- Fix to variation module recordContexts isolation to make it dedicated
  to each Variaiton Module+Agent instance.

  variation modules.
- Fix to record parsers/builders to fail on empty values.
- Fix to snmprec.py & pcap2dev.py in part of processed OIDs counting.

Revision 0.2.4, released 04-10-2013
-----------------------------------

- A tool for building SNMP Simulator data files from network
  packet captures added.
- Automatic online data file index rebuild on data file timestamp 
  change implemented.
- The sql variation module tweaked to be better compliant with
  Python DB API 2.0 so that it can now work with MySQL out of
  the box. Module options also reworked to support named
  DB connect() parameters.
- Simulator can now run many independent SNMP engines each with its
  own set of data files listening at dedicated transport endpoints.
  At least pysnmp 4.2.5 is required for this feature to work.
- Simulator now accepts the --transport-id-offset command-line parameter
  to specify the initial transport ID instance for each transport domain
  configured.
- Variation module API changed to allow recording module to communicate
  to its host time of the next probe to occur. 
- Variation module API changed so that SNMP engine ID is only available
  in variate() context. This is due to the new multi-engine ID design.
- New --args-from-file command-line parameter added to snmpsimd.py to 
  allow a large number of SNMP engines configured to Simulator. The
  --agent-endpoint\*-list= family of options discontinued in favor of
  multiple --agent-\*-endpoint options read from args file.
- Distribute is gone, switching to setuptools completely.
- Default logging destination for all tools is now stderr.

Revision 0.2.3, released 01-08-2013
-----------------------------------

- Simulator now supports a list of interfaces to listen on through
  the --agent-endpoint\*-list=<file> family of options. It's intended
  for simulation a very large pool of devices.
- Introducing new command-line utility "datafile.py" designed to manage data
  files. Features include: merging, splitting, sorting, de-duplicating,
  convertion between data file formats.
- Automatic log file rotation feature implemented.
- A number of improvement to the mib2dev.py tool:

  * Columnar objects for table indices are now automatically populated
    from index values
  * Tables are can now be populated with arbitrary number of rows
  * Hex values can now be given at the prompt using the 0x syntax
  * Default automatic value ranges for integers are now much smaller
    to increase a chance of automatic selection.
  * Values ranges can now be set for each SNMP type separately.
  * When generating values, make N probes choosing random values for 
    better automation
  * Produced values are sorted and de-duplicated.
  * Fix to OID range checking when specified at the command-line.

- Help messages made more readable and complete.
- Data file search code fixed (not to crash Simulator in corner cases)
  and simplified.
- Variable conflict fixed that broke --v2c-arch option operations.
- Fix to OIDs ordering in --v2c-arch GETBULK responder.

  to ease the understanding of their operation.
- The --quiet flag of snmprec.py now deprecated in favor of "null"
  logging method.
- Variation modules execution environment extended to provide contexts
  for three scopes: record, agent and module. This simplifies modules
  implementation in terms of storing and managing state/configuration
  informaton on per-OID/per-Agent and global basis.
- The snmprec.py tool now supports DNS names in c/l target parameter.
- New 'cumulative' flag added to the numeric.py variation module.
- The multiplex module improved to allow .snmprec file selection via
  SNMP SET.
- Fatal exceptions are now fully logged.
- Type checking is now performed on SET operation at writecache module.

  platform-dependent.

Revision 0.2.1, released 07-04-2013
-----------------------------------

- WARNING: this release brings some backward incompatibilities in

    * variation modules names and options
    * snmpsimd.py community names (in Windows platform)
    * stock variation modules installation location
    * sql module OID format stored in database

  Please read the changes below for more information.

- License updated to vanilla BSD 2-Clause
  (http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
- Variation modules can now participate in .snmprec production what
  can be used for capturing additional information about SNMP Agent
  being snapshotted in .snmprec files.
  The following changes have been made to the system:

  * the snmprec.py tool can be passed variation module name.
  * variation modules can now define the 'record' callable which
    will be given a chance to influence snmprec record being written.
  * existing 'process' callable in variation modules renamed into
    'variate' for clarity.
  * variation modules' init() and shutdown() methods accept \*\*context,
    'mode' parameter being passed indicating current operation mode.
  * variation modules running in recording mode can communicate to
    the upper levels that they either won't produce any data on the
    current invocation or request another round of SNMP Agent walk.

- Variation modules options now take shape of a key-value pairs. This
  might break backward compatibility with 0.2.0!
- The counter.py and gauge.py variation modules merged into a single
  numeric.py module which also supports INTEGER&TIMETICKS values as
  well as recording feature.
- The involatilecache.py and volatilecache.py modules merged into a
  single writecache.py module which also supports SET value verification
  against per-OID access list.
- The error.py variation module extended to support variation based on
  SET value.
- The delay.py variation module extended to support variation based on
  SET value and time of date.
- Format of the OID stored in SQL database changed in a backward incompatible 
  manner.
- Recording functionality added to the delay.py and numeric.py modules.
- The new "multiplex" variation module added to be able to record
  and replay a sequence of .snmprec files ordered by time.
- SNMP GETBULK operation is now supported by snmprec.py.
- Redesign of grammar objects -- the new concept is that they
  are only responsible for basic record layout, fields normalization.
  and SNMP types resolution. However complex field formatting (such
  as grammar-specific tag modifiers) is now up to higher-level
  'Record' objects.
- Simulator-generated community names now uses '/' as path separator
  regardless of the platform. This allows for unified Simulator view
  in terms of community and context names across the platforms.
- Snapshot files recording now works under Python3.
- Install data and variation modules into package root to make easy_install
  work again. Search these directories at runtime as a last resort - prefer
  system or home locations as it is more natural to keep changing data there.
- Simulator is now more tolerant to duplicate variation modules (just ignores
  recently found) and catches duplicate data files (also ignores more recent).
- On Windows, search both data and variation modules into %PROGRAMFILES%

Revision 0.2.0, released 12-03-2013
-----------------------------------

- Major overhaul aimed at adding value variation features to the Simulator
  core:

  * data files may now hold not only terminal OIDs but also OID subtrees
  * pluggable value variation modules interfaces and basic modules added
  * write support added through the use of appropriate variation modules
  * SQL backend for keeping and modifying SNMP snapshots added in form of
    a value variation module
  * subprocess execution variation module added what could be used
    for external process invocation on SNMP request to Simulator
  * SNMP Notification Originator variation module added what could be
    used for sending SNMP TRAP/INFORM messages to SNMP entities
    on SNMP requests to Simulator

- SNMP snapshots now being called 'data files' rather than 'device files'
  which is a legacy term.
- Data files and variation modules are now installed into platform-specific
  directories.
- Data files and variation modules are now looked up at several, 
  platform-specific, locations including $HOME/.snmpsim
- Simulator data files indices are now created and kept in a dedicated
  temporary directory which is also configurable though snmpsimd command-line.
- Example data files simplified, more native and foreign snapshots added.
- Fix to snmprec.py not to record end-of-mib.
- Fix to py2exe settings of setup.py

  endpoints. The --agent-address & --agent-port options are now obsolete.
- The snmprec.py tool Agent address specification syntax unified with that
  of snmpsimd.py.
- Multiple --device-dir c/l options are now supported by snmpsimd.py.
- Some runtime diagnostics added to snmprec.py.

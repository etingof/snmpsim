Revision 1.0.0, released XX-12-2019
-----------------------------------

- Command-line tools refactored into entry-points and renamed for better
  clarity and name spacing for the upcoming tools:

  * snmpsimd.py -> snmpsim-command-responder
  * snmprec.py -> snmpsim-record-commands
  * mib2dev.py -> snmpsim-record-mibs
  * pcap2dev.py -> snmpsim-record-traffic
  * datafile.py -> snmpsim-manage-records

- Python 2.4-2.6 support has been dropped.

- Converted integration tests from depending on @snmplabs.com to local,
  autonomous test suite.

- Replace `getopt` with `argparse` in all CLI tools The latter is way more
  advanced and Pythonic.

  Due to differences in `getopt` vs `argparse` usage model, slight changes
  in tools' behavior is not impossible.

  Some legacy, backward compatibility CLI options have been dropped by
  way of this change.

- Remove `execfile` use on Py2.

- Split monolithic command responder onto many specialized modules and
  two command responder applications: one implementing fully-fledged
  SNMPv3 architecture (supporting all SNMP versions) and the other
  implementing just v1 and v2c. The second one is lighter on the
  resources.

  So we now have two daemons:

  * snmpsim-command-responder
  * snmpsim-command-responder-lite

- Add activity reporting feature

  On every query, SNMP simulator command responder calls its
  "reporting" subsystem. If configured, it invokes one of the
  "modules" responsible for doing something with request
  information.

  Included modules ("fulljson" and "minimaljson" reporters) accumulate
  and periodically dump JSON documents containing request counters scoped
  by SNMP command processing steps.

  Future modules may just send out the information to external
  collectors e.g. Graphite/Carbon or store it in some other format
  e.g. Prometheus.

Revision 0.4.8, released XX-08-2019
-----------------------------------

- Code base PEP8'ed
- Added support for SNMP Context Engine ID mapping to the file system paths.
  This feature allows for every single SNMP engine to simulate multiple
  SNMP contexts based on different .snmprec files. On top of that, this
  feature simplifies the mapping of empty SNMP community and context names
  to .snmprec files.
- Added support for simulation based on compressed .snmprec files using
  bzip2 compression algorithm (.snmprec.bz2), as well as recording straight
  into this compressed format.
  By way of implementing this change, all snmpsim tools have been generalized
  to variate and record using any of the supported simulation file formats (for
  as long as chosen format supports variation or recording).
- Run snmpsimd variation modules initialization under non-privileged user
- MIB resolution failure handling improved in `mib2dev`
- Rearranged documentation, removed public SNMP simulator page

  logger and variation modules subsystems under reduced user privileges
- Improve error reporting in `notification` variation module

Revision 0.4.5, released 30-12-2018
-----------------------------------

- Copyright notice bumped up to year 2019

  and reflect that in the log -- that should ease troubleshooting
- Optional .snmprec tag modifier is ignored by the *error*,
  *delay*, *writecache* and *notification* variation modules
- Fixed DBM file index detection code to operate correctly
- Fixed pysnmp/pyasn1 debugging flags print out in `--help` to work
  with newer pyasn1/pysnmp

Revision 0.3.0, released 28-09-2015
-----------------------------------

- Simulator now depends on the latest pysnmp features introduced in 
  pysnmp version 4.3.0
- Introducing initial MIB compiler (PySMI) integration. Most command-line
  tools can now be given MIB symbols rather than OIDs. Requested
  MIBs will be automatically downloaded from http://mibs.snmplabs.com/ .
- New Redis-backed variation module implemented to let users record into
  and replay simulation data from noSQL key-value store optionally
  involving server-side Lua scripting.
- Full-line comments (#-based) and empty lines are now allowed in data files.
- When recording .snmprec data, hex everything if a non-alpha/numeric
  literal is present in a value. This eliminates possible issues with
  unescaped contents in a SQL-based recorder.
- New --max-varbinds option can now be used for limiting the number
  of variable bindings in SNMP response message on a per-engine-id
  basis. Global default is now 64 variable bindings.
- Multiple SNMP ContextEngineID can now be configured per each of possibly
  many SNMP Engine IDs.
- SNMP configuration logging reworked for better clarity.
- The notification module now binds to the same local interface through
  which Simulator received CommandRequest triggering notification. 
  Also it supports 'bindaddr' option to override the above behaviour on
  a per-OID basis.
- The sql variation module not switches default SQL transaction isolation
  level to 'READ COMMITTED'. Isolation level (0-3) could now be specified
  on per-instance basis through 'isolationlevel' option.
- The subprocess variation module improved to expose more SNMP engine
  parameters to user process.
- Switched to the latest pysnmp's requestObserver facility for getting
  request details from pysnmp core.
- Numeric module's 'function' parameter now accepts optional arguments.
- The snmprec.py tool improved to optionally survive SNMP PDU-level errors
  and keep walking remote Agent using an OID derived from the failed one.
- Configurable SNMP request timeout and retry count settings now supported
  by the snmprec.py tool.
- The --context-engine-id option support added to snmprec.py tool.
- Hex values can now be passed to --v3-context-\* options to snmprec.py tool
- Variation modules options separators can now be escaped by doubling or
  tripling them.
- All logging moved to Python logging framework. Some more log targets (such
  as remote syslog) added.
- Low-level SNMP and ASN.1 debugging implemented for all relevant scripts.
- Configure both plain-text and hashed versions of snmpCommunityName,
  contextName whenever its length does not exceed 32 chars. That might ease
  ContextName usage for Agent addressing.
- Wheel distribution format now supported.
- Fix to log file autorotation feature.
- Fix to pcap2dev.py not to loose the last trailing OID in capture.
- Fix to variation module recordContexts isolation to make it dedicated
  to each Variaiton Module+Agent instance.

- Fix to off-by-one errorIndex as reported by error.py and writecache.py
  variation modules.
- Fix to record parsers/builders to fail on empty values.
- Fix to snmprec.py & pcap2dev.py in part of processed OIDs counting.

Revision 0.2.4, released 04-10-2013
-----------------------------------

- A tool for building SNMP Simulator data files from network
  packet captures added.
- Automatic online data file index rebuild on data file timestamp 
  change implemented.
- The sql variation module tweaked to be better compliant with
  Python DB API 2.0 so that it can now work with MySQL out of
  the box. Module options also reworked to support named
  DB connect() parameters.
- Simulator can now run many independent SNMP engines each with its
  own set of data files listening at dedicated transport endpoints.
  At least pysnmp 4.2.5 is required for this feature to work.
- Simulator now accepts the --transport-id-offset command-line parameter
  to specify the initial transport ID instance for each transport domain
  configured.
- Variation module API changed to allow recording module to communicate
  to its host time of the next probe to occur. 
- Variation module API changed so that SNMP engine ID is only available
  in variate() context. This is due to the new multi-engine ID design.
- New --args-from-file command-line parameter added to snmpsimd.py to 
  allow a large number of SNMP engines configured to Simulator. The
  --agent-endpoint\*-list= family of options discontinued in favor of
  multiple --agent-\*-endpoint options read from args file.
- Distribute is gone, switching to setuptools completely.
- Default logging destination for all tools is now stderr.
- The --version option of snmprec.py renamed into --protocol-version.
- New command-line option --pid-file added.

  defaulted into all numerical types.
- Fix to PID file creation on daemonization.
- Fixes to stdio binary mode write to work with Python 3.

Revision 0.2.3, released 01-08-2013
-----------------------------------

- Simulator now supports a list of interfaces to listen on through
  the --agent-endpoint\*-list=<file> family of options. It's intended
  for simulation a very large pool of devices.
- Introducing new command-line utility "datafile.py" designed to manage data
  files. Features include: merging, splitting, sorting, de-duplicating,
  convertion between data file formats.
- Automatic log file rotation feature implemented.
- A number of improvement to the mib2dev.py tool:

  * Columnar objects for table indices are now automatically populated
    from index values
  * Tables are can now be populated with arbitrary number of rows
  * Hex values can now be given at the prompt using the 0x syntax
  * Default automatic value ranges for integers are now much smaller
    to increase a chance of automatic selection.
  * Values ranges can now be set for each SNMP type separately.
  * When generating values, make N probes choosing random values for 
    better automation
  * Produced values are sorted and de-duplicated.
  * Fix to OID range checking when specified at the command-line.

- Help messages made more readable and complete.
- Data file search code fixed (not to crash Simulator in corner cases)
  and simplified.
- Variable conflict fixed that broke --v2c-arch option operations.
- Fix to OIDs ordering in --v2c-arch GETBULK responder.

- More logging added into snmpsimd.py, snmprec.py and variation modules
  to ease the understanding of their operation.
- The --quiet flag of snmprec.py now deprecated in favor of "null"
  logging method.
- Variation modules execution environment extended to provide contexts
  for three scopes: record, agent and module. This simplifies modules
  implementation in terms of storing and managing state/configuration
  informaton on per-OID/per-Agent and global basis.
- The snmprec.py tool now supports DNS names in c/l target parameter.
- New 'cumulative' flag added to the numeric.py variation module.
- The multiplex module improved to allow .snmprec file selection via
  SNMP SET.
- Fatal exceptions are now fully logged.
- Type checking is now performed on SET operation at writecache module.

  variation logic. It appeared broken on Windows only since 0.2.1.
- Fix to snmprec.py behaviour on missing variation module directory.
- Fix to .snmpwalk grammar parser to support Network Address type tag.

- Fix to OID search in a .snmprec in case of a subtree configured
  on the last line of .snmprec file.
- Fix to line separator character used in file logger -- now it's
  platform-dependent.

Revision 0.2.1, released 07-04-2013
-----------------------------------

- WARNING: this release brings some backward incompatibilities in

    * variation modules names and options
    * snmpsimd.py community names (in Windows platform)
    * stock variation modules installation location
    * sql module OID format stored in database

  Please read the changes below for more information.

- License updated to vanilla BSD 2-Clause
  (http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
- Variation modules can now participate in .snmprec production what
  can be used for capturing additional information about SNMP Agent
  being snapshotted in .snmprec files.
  The following changes have been made to the system:

  * the snmprec.py tool can be passed variation module name.
  * variation modules can now define the 'record' callable which
    will be given a chance to influence snmprec record being written.
  * existing 'process' callable in variation modules renamed into
    'variate' for clarity.
  * variation modules' init() and shutdown() methods accept \*\*context,
    'mode' parameter being passed indicating current operation mode.
  * variation modules running in recording mode can communicate to
    the upper levels that they either won't produce any data on the
    current invocation or request another round of SNMP Agent walk.

- Variation modules options now take shape of a key-value pairs. This
  might break backward compatibility with 0.2.0!
- The counter.py and gauge.py variation modules merged into a single
  numeric.py module which also supports INTEGER&TIMETICKS values as
  well as recording feature.
- The involatilecache.py and volatilecache.py modules merged into a
  single writecache.py module which also supports SET value verification
  against per-OID access list.
- The error.py variation module extended to support variation based on
  SET value.
- The delay.py variation module extended to support variation based on
  SET value and time of date.
- Format of the OID stored in SQL database changed in a backward incompatible 
  manner.
- Recording functionality added to the delay.py and numeric.py modules.
- The new "multiplex" variation module added to be able to record
  and replay a sequence of .snmprec files ordered by time.
- SNMP GETBULK operation is now supported by snmprec.py.
- Redesign of grammar objects -- the new concept is that they
  are only responsible for basic record layout, fields normalization.
  and SNMP types resolution. However complex field formatting (such
  as grammar-specific tag modifiers) is now up to higher-level
  'Record' objects.
- Simulator-generated community names now uses '/' as path separator
  regardless of the platform. This allows for unified Simulator view
  in terms of community and context names across the platforms.
- Snapshot files recording now works under Python3.
- Install data and variation modules into package root to make easy_install
  work again. Search these directories at runtime as a last resort - prefer
  system or home locations as it is more natural to keep changing data there.
- Simulator is now more tolerant to duplicate variation modules (just ignores
  recently found) and catches duplicate data files (also ignores more recent).
- On Windows, search both data and variation modules into %PROGRAMFILES%

Revision 0.2.0, released 12-03-2013
-----------------------------------

- Major overhaul aimed at adding value variation features to the Simulator
  core:

  * data files may now hold not only terminal OIDs but also OID subtrees
  * pluggable value variation modules interfaces and basic modules added
  * write support added through the use of appropriate variation modules
  * SQL backend for keeping and modifying SNMP snapshots added in form of
    a value variation module
  * subprocess execution variation module added what could be used
    for external process invocation on SNMP request to Simulator
  * SNMP Notification Originator variation module added what could be
    used for sending SNMP TRAP/INFORM messages to SNMP entities
    on SNMP requests to Simulator

- SNMP snapshots now being called 'data files' rather than 'device files'
  which is a legacy term.
- Data files and variation modules are now installed into platform-specific
  directories.
- Data files and variation modules are now looked up at several, 
  platform-specific, locations including $HOME/.snmpsim
- Simulator data files indices are now created and kept in a dedicated
  temporary directory which is also configurable though snmpsimd command-line.
- Example data files simplified, more native and foreign snapshots added.
- Fix to snmprec.py not to record end-of-mib.
- Fix to py2exe settings of setup.py

  endpoints. The --agent-address & --agent-port options are now obsolete.
- The snmprec.py tool Agent address specification syntax unified with that
  of snmpsimd.py.
- Multiple --device-dir c/l options are now supported by snmpsimd.py.
- Some runtime diagnostics added to snmprec.py.
- The snmpsimd.py tool unconditionally rebuilds existing indices of
  unknown format.
